# Pascal Data Structures

A comprehensive repository of individual Pascal programs, each implementing a different classic data structure, algorithm, or problem-solving technique.  
Ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding or teaching the foundations of data structures using Pascal.

## About

This collection contains standalone Pascal programs, each one focused on a specific data structure or algorithm.  
You will find clear, well-commented code covering the basics (arrays, stacks, queues, lists) as well as more advanced or less common structures, with illustrative main programs.

**Each file is independent and can be run or studied on its own for maximum clarity.**

## Contents

Below is a list of all included Pascal files/programs.  
_(Section for individual write-ups of each program will go here as you supply details for each file.)_

### Source Files

## How to Use

1. **Browse the source files** above; pick a data structure or algorithm.
2. **Open the `.pas` file** in your favourite text editor or Pascal IDE.
3. **Compile and run** using any modern Pascal compiler (e.g., Free Pascal, Turbo Pascal).
4. **Experiment, learn, and modify** the code as desired.

Example (using Free Pascal):
```bash
fpc binary_tree.pas
./binary_tree
```
